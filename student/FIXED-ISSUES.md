# Fixed Issues - Navigation & Missing Pages

## Summary
All critical navigation and routing bugs have been fixed, and missing pages have been implemented with full functionality using mock data.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Exam Start Button Navigation
**Problem:** Clicking "ابدأ الامتحان" button did not navigate to exam player
**Solution:** 
- Created `ExamPlayerPage.tsx` with route `/exams/:id/take`
- Added onClick handler to navigate to exam player in `ExamsPage.tsx`
- Implemented timer, question navigation, and submit flow
- Created `ExamResultPage.tsx` with route `/exams/:id/result` for showing results

**Files Changed:**
- `src/pages/ExamPlayerPage.tsx` (new)
- `src/pages/ExamResultPage.tsx` (new)
- `src/pages/ExamsPage.tsx` (updated line 144)
- `src/App.tsx` (added routes)

### 2. ✅ Course Internal Page Missing
**Problem:** Clicking "دخول الكورس" resulted in 404
**Solution:**
- Created `CourseDetailPage.tsx` with route `/courses/:id`
- Implemented tabs for lessons, exams, and assignments
- Added mock lessons data
- Fixed navigation in `Dashboard.tsx` and `CoursesPage.tsx` to use correct route

**Files Changed:**
- `src/pages/CourseDetailPage.tsx` (new)
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (line 129: `/course/` → `/courses/`)
- `src/pages/CoursesPage.tsx` (line 241: `/course/` → `/courses/`)
- `src/App.tsx` (added route)

### 3. ✅ Notes Page Missing
**Problem:** Sidebar link to المذكرات led to 404
**Solution:**
- Created `NotesPage.tsx` with route `/notes`
- Implemented full checkout flow with form validation
- Added mock notes data with images
- Checkout saves to localStorage

**Files Changed:**
- `src/pages/NotesPage.tsx` (new)
- `src/App.tsx` (added route)

### 4. ✅ Assignments Page Missing
**Problem:** Sidebar link to الواجبات led to 404
**Solution:**
- Created `AssignmentsPage.tsx` with route `/assignments`
- Implemented assignment list with status tracking
- Added submission dialog with file upload
- Mock grading display

**Files Changed:**
- `src/pages/AssignmentsPage.tsx` (new)
- `src/App.tsx` (added route)

### 5. ✅ 404 Page Enhancement
**Problem:** Generic error page without Arabic support
**Solution:**
- Updated `NotFound.tsx` with Arabic messages
- Added navigation buttons to dashboard and courses
- Styled with design system tokens

**Files Changed:**
- `src/pages/NotFound.tsx` (complete redesign)

### 6. ✅ Navigation Robustness
**Problem:** Inconsistent route naming and missing error handling
**Solution:**
- Standardized all routes in `App.tsx`
- Fixed route param usage (`:id` instead of `[id]` - this is React Router, not Next.js)
- Added defensive checks in all pages for missing data
- Updated all navigation calls to use correct paths

**Files Changed:**
- `src/App.tsx` (updated all routes and imports)
- All page components (added error handling)
